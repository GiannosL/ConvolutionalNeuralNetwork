<h1>A simple implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks</h1>

<p>
    The goal is to create a package that contains an automated implementation of a CNN. The model is 
    going to take as input jpeg images, manipulate them and train on them in order to make predictions.
</p>

<h2>Image input module</h2>
<p>
    Loads and prepares images for training.
</p>

<h2>Neural Network</h2>
<p>
    This is a Convolutional Neural Network which can take as input the image 
    object and uses it to make predictions.
