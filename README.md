<h1>A simple implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks</h1>

<p>
    The goal is to create a package that contains an automated implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
    The model is going to take as input jpeg images, manipulate them and train on them in order to make predictions.
</p>

<h2>Image input module</h2>
<p>
    Loads and prepares images for training. The data-object should be optimal for use in the CNN. Images should also be 
    optimized for use when they are taken as input or at least there should be an option for it.
</p>

<h2>Neural Network</h2>
<p>
    This is a Convolutional Neural Network which can take as input the image 
    object and uses it to make predictions.
